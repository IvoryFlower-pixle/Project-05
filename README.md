# Project 5
## Implementation / Features you added
- Made maze big
- Multiple levels
- Added sound effects and music (made by me)
- Changed the enemy model (Also made by me)
- used the lights to make the maze feel kinda scary/creative use of lighting

- Side note: I used dark wood, marble, and plastic textures. It's just hard to see because of the lighting
